<!-- Text Input Controls
There are three types of text input used on forms −

Single-line text input controls − This control is used for items that require only one line of user input, such as search boxes or names. They are created using HTML <input> tag.

Password input controls − This is also a single-line text input but it masks the character as soon as a user enters it. They are also created using HTMl <input> tag.

Multi-line text input controls − This is used when the user is required to give details that may be longer than a single sentence.
 Multi-line input controls are created using HTML <textarea> tag. -->
