<!-- HTML - Attributes

 
We have seen few HTML tags and their usage like heading tags <h1>, <h2>, 
paragraph tag <p> and other tags. We used them so far in their simplest form, but most of the HTML tags can also have attributes, which are extra bits of information.

An attribute is used to define the characteristics of an HTML element and is placed 
inside the element's opening tag. All attributes are made up of two parts âˆ’ 
a name and a value

The name is the property you want to set. For example, the paragraph <p> 
element in the example carries an attribute whose name is align,
which you can use to indicate the alignment of paragraph on the page.

The value is what you want the value of the property to be set and always put within 
quotations. 
The below example shows three possible values of align attribute: left, center and right -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>attribute</title>
</head>
<body>
   <p align ="left">this is left align</p>
   <p align ="right">this is right align</p>
   <p align =" center">thi is center align</p>
</body>
</html>
<!-- core attribute -->
