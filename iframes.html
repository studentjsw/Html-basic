The <Iframe> Tag Attributes
    1	
src

This attribute is used to give the file name that should be loaded in the frame.
 Its value can be any URL. For example, src = "/html/top_frame.htm" will load an HTML 
 file available in html directory.

2	
name

This attribute allows you to give a name to a frame. 
It is used to indicate which frame a document should be loaded into. 
This is especially important when you want to create links in one frame that load pages into an another frame, in which case the second frame needs a name to identify itself as the target of the link.

3	
frameborder

This attribute specifies whether or not the borders of that frame are shown; 
it overrides the value given in the frameborder attribute on the 
<frameset> tag if one is given, and this can take values either 1 (yes) or 0 (no).

4	
marginwidth

This attribute allows you to specify the width of the space 
between the left and right of the frame's borders and the frame's content. 
The value is given in pixels. For example marginwidth = "10".

5	
marginheight

This attribute allows you to specify the 
height of the space between the top and bottom of the frame's borders and its contents. 
The value is given in pixels. For example marginheight = "10".

6	
height

This attribute specifies the height of <iframe>.

7	
scrolling

This attribute controls the appearance of the scrollbars that appear on the frame. 
This takes values either "yes", "no" or "auto".
 For example scrolling = "no" means it should not have scroll bars.

This attribute allows you to provide a 
link to another page containing a long description of the contents of the frame.
